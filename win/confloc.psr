@ This allows you to define where ZSNES settings are stored
@ and enables/disables multiuser support.
@
@ 0 = User's directory contains ZSNES config files. (multiuser)
@ 1 = ZSNES directory contains ZSNES config files. (no multiuser)
@
@ On 9x system that all users don't have seperate profiles,
@ the user's directory will be:
@ <windows directory>\Application Data\ZSNES
@
@ On 9x systems that are configured to use seperate profiles,
@ the user's directory will be:
@ <windows directory>\Profiles\<username>\Application Data\ZSNES
@
@ On older NT systems, the user's directory will be:
@ C:\Documents and Settings\<username>\Application Data\ZSNES
@
@ On NT 6+ (Vista) the user's directory will be:
@ C:\Users\<username>\Saved Games\ZSNES
@ Or if that fails for some reason, it will be:
@ C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\ZSNES
@
@ Note: all the default locations listed above can be changed
@ in Windows using software such as TweakUI.
@
@
@ If you plan on putting ZSNES on a CD, it is advisable to
@ enable multiuser here so you can save your settings on
@ any machine you use the CD in.
@
@ If you want different copies of ZSNES tweaked for different
@ things, you can disable multiuser support and each directory
@ with ZSNES will contain it's own configuration settings.
@
@ If one user of your PC would like to use the User's directory
@ for settings and another wants the ZSNES directory, just
@ copy ZSNES into two different directories and edit this file
@ appropriatly in both of them.
